## Overview
This project recreates the **AI assistant I originally built at PILOT (pilot.coach)** for Sales & Marketing teams.  
The assistant leverages **CRM data and market research** to generate:
- Personalized outbound email sequences (with A/B subject lines & placeholders)  
- Webinar scripts and follow-up emails  
- Strategy snapshots with data-backed insights and recommended experiments

## Problem
Sales teams often spend hours on manual research and generic outreach, limiting efficiency and pipeline growth.  
We needed a way to **automate research and content creation** while ensuring personalization and ROI-driven messaging.

## My Role
- Co-designed and prototyped the assistant in **OpenAI Playground**  
- Configured data ingestion (CSV + Markdown) and prompt logic  
- Authored prompts for email generation, webinar scripts, and strategy insights  
- Ensured outputs stayed grounded in business ROI and customer context

## Impact
- **5 hours saved** of research time per webinar  
- **100 personalized emails/week** enabled per salesperson  
- Contributed to **~$2M in new sales pipeline**  
- Delivered a repeatable AI workflow blending data, research, and strategy

## Key Product Insight
AI outreach succeeded when it combined **human context (CRM personalization)** with **clear ROI metrics** like time savings and revenue impact.
