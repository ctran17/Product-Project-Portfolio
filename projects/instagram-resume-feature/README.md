# Instagram — Resume & Recently Viewed

**Problem:** Users lose the Reel/post they were viewing when the app refreshes on reopen.  
**Proposal:** A lightweight **“Continue watching?”** toast + an optional **Recently Viewed** list (last 10 items).

**Goals:** +15% Reel completion; +10% session time; improved sentiment.  
**Constraints:** Privacy (opt-in history), protect fresh content (limit history scope).
