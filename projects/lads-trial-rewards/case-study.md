# Product Case Study: Improving Rewards & Player Retention in *Love and Deepspace*

## Problem Statement
F2P and casual players feel punished by scarce rewards and high resource requirements in progression systems like Trials/Directional Orbits. Current mechanics create anxiety and discourage long-term play, especially for users who joined primarily for story immersion rather than grind.

This mismatch contributes to player frustration, drop-off, and negative sentiment in community spaces (Reddit, Instagram, YouTube).

## Goals & Success Metrics
- **Increase Day 30 retention** among F2P players by +10%.
- **Reduce average time stuck** per Trial stage from “months” to “weeks.”
- **Improve community sentiment** (measured by survey/NPS or reduced “scarce rewards” complaints on social platforms).

---

## Target Users
- **Primary:** F2P and casual players (often women drawn in by narrative, not grind).  
- **Secondary:** Low-spenders who want value but feel drained by the current system.  
- **Tertiary:** New gacha players unfamiliar with resource-scarce economies.

## Proposed Solution: Reward Economy Adjustment

### 1. Increase Baseline Rewards
- Double Diamonds (20 → 40) for Trial completions.  
- Affinity boost per win (300 → 500).  

### 2. Introduce Progression Milestones
- Example: “Complete 3 Trials this week → bonus 200 affinity + 50 Diamonds.”  
- Creates smaller, repeatable wins for F2P players.  

### 3. Affinity-Friendly Events
- Add periodic F2P-focused events with affinity tokens as rewards.  
- Lets story-focused players progress without battling at whale-level intensity.

## Constraints & Trade-Offs
- **Business Risk:** Lowering reliance on P2W could reduce whale revenue.  
  - *Mitigation:* Keep prestige rewards (exclusive skins, limited banners) monetized, while making baseline progression healthier.  
- **Design Risk:** Reward inflation could trivialize game progression.  
  - *Mitigation:* Adjust difficulty scaling slightly upward for high-level whales, while leaving F2P baseline smoother.

## Success Criteria
**Quantitative:**  
- +10% Day 30 F2P retention  
- +20% faster Trial completion rate  
- Increased story affinity unlock rate per user  

**Qualitative:**  
- Reduced frustration/complaint volume on social platforms  
- Improved NPS (surveyed)
