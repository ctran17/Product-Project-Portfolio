# Love and Deepspace — Trial Rewards Redesign

## Overview
This case study explores how adjusting *Love and Deepspace’s* Trial rewards system could reduce churn and improve F2P player retention. Current rewards feel scarce and punishing, especially for story-focused players, creating anxiety and negative sentiment in the community.

## Proposal (Snapshot)
- **Regular Trials (most levels):** 30 Diamonds • 3,000 Gold • +500 Affinity  
- **Milestone Trials (Lv. 10n):** 60 Diamonds • 5,000 Gold • +500 Affinity • 1 Empyrean Wish • 1 Random Item  
- **Weekly Milestones:** 3/6/9 Trials → +20💎 / +200❤️ / +50💎  
*(Respects 3 trials/character/day cap + weekday availability)*

## Goals
- +10% Day 30 retention (F2P cohort)  
- +20% faster Trial completion rate  
- Higher story affinity unlock rate
