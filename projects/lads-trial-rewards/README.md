# Love and Deepspace — Trial Rewards Redesign

**Problem.** F2P/casual players feel punished by scarce rewards and high Trial difficulty; mismatch with story-first marketing drives frustration and churn.

**Proposal.**
- Regular Trial: 30 Diamonds • 3,000 Gold • +500 Affinity  
- Milestone Trial (Lv. 10n): 60 Diamonds • 5,000 Gold • +500 Affinity • 1 Empyrean Wish • 1 Random Item  
- Weekly Milestones: 3/6/9 Trials → +20💎 / +200❤️ / +50💎  
*Note: respects per-character daily cap + weekday orbit limits.*
